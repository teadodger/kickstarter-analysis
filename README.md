# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Analyzing the outcomes of past Kickstarter data to identify trends of successful campaigns and use them to advise a client on how to create a new successful theater campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges
Analysis performed on Kickstarter data using Excel.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The data shows that campaigns launched between May and June have been most successful with a 65-67% success rate, while December is the month with the lowest success for campaign launches, at 49%. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

There is a clear trend of successful outcomes for campaigns with goals under 15,000 dollars and a break-even 50/50 result for campaigns with goals between 15,000 and 19,999 dollars. Above this point, from 20,000 to 34,999 dollars, failing campaigns far outnumber successful ones, but this trend reverses briefly from 35,000 to 44,999 dollars, in which range most campaigns did succeed. However, the trend of high goals correlating with failing outcomes resumes for those campaigns with the highest goals; failing campaigns heavily outnumber successful ones when the goal is set at 45,000 dollars or more.

## Results
The data trends indicate that the best time for the client to launch her campaign would be in May or June. If possible, the client should also avoid launching in the winter months as campaigns launched in both December and January have had the lowest success rate.

My recommendation would be to launch with a goal under 15,000 dollars because there is a clear pattern of success for campaigns with goals under this dollar figure. However, if the client needs to raise a larger amount, they may have success with a goal in the 35,000-45,000 range. In which case, I would suggest digging into more information about the subset of 9 campaigns with goals of 35,000-45,000 because the campaigns in this small subset buck the trend, showing a 67% success rate. Perhaps looking into their bonus gift levels and incentives would shed light on what might have moved the needle for them at higher pledge levels.
 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The current dataset does not reveal how many people pledged at different levels and what incentives were offered. This additional information might help to reveal patterns in which types of incentives were most successful in pushing donations up to higher pledge points.

It might be helpful to create a graph that shows how many backers were needed to push successful theater projects over the top. And if the data included how many people pledged at different key levels then we could create a chart that expresses how much the needle was moved by small donations vs large ones.
