# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### An analysis of Kickstarter theater funding campaign outcomes to identify trends that will help a client create a successful new theater campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges
Analysis performed on historical Kickstarter data using Excel.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Campaigns launched between May and June are historically the most successful with a 65-67% success rate, while December is the month with the lowest percentage of success for campaign launches, at 49%.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
There is a clear trend of successful outcomes for campaigns with goals under 15,000 dollars and a break-even 50/50 result for campaigns with goals between 15,000 and 19,999 dollars. Above this point, from 20,000 to 34,999 dollars, failing campaigns far outnumber successful ones, but this trend reverses briefly from 35,000 to 44,999 dollars, in which range most campaigns did succeed. However, the trend of high goals correlating with failing outcomes resumes for those campaigns with the highest goals; failing campaigns heavily outnumber successful ones when the goal is set at 45,000 dollars or more.

## Results
The data trends indicate that the best time for the client to launch her campaign would be in May or June. If possible, the client should also avoid launching in the winter months as campaigns launched in both December and January have had the lowest success rate.

My recommendation would be to launch with a goal under 15,000 dollars because there is a clear pattern of success for campaigns with goals under this goal amount. However, if the client needs to raise a larger amount, the data also supports a goal in the 35,000-45,000 range, which showed a 67% success rate. 
 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The current dataset does not reveal how many people pledged at different levels and what incentives were offered. This additional information might help to reveal patterns in which types of incentives were most successful in pushing donations up to higher pledge points. 

It might be helpful to create an additional graph that shows how many backers were needed to push successful theater projects over the top. Also, if the data included how many people pledged at different levels then we could unearth patterns that express how much the needle was moved by small donations vs large ones.
